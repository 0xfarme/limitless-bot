# Strategy: Early Entry (Quick Scalp Hold) + Moonshot Hedge
# ========================================

# ========= RPC Configuration =========
# Multiple RPC endpoints for redundancy and performance
# Order: fastest/most reliable first. Bot will fallback to next if one fails.
# Recommended: Use at least 2-3 endpoints from different providers

# POLL_INTERVAL_MS: How often to check markets (milliseconds)
#   - 10000ms (10s): Fast, responsive, higher RPC usage - RECOMMENDED for active trading
#   - 15000ms (15s): Balanced performance and RPC usage
#   - 20000ms (20s): Lower RPC usage, still catches opportunities
#   Note: Bot automatically optimizes RPC calls during quiet periods

# Time windows: Sequential opportunity windows where bot can place 1 trade per market
# Bot checks windows in order (earliest to latest) and only buys if odds are better
# Format: "start-end,start-end" in minutes remaining (countdown from deadline)
# Example: "0-2,2-4" means bot checks 0-2min window first, then 2-4min window
#          If odds at 3min are better than at 1min, it will buy in the later window
