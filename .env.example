# Strategy: Early Entry (Quick Scalp Hold) + Moonshot Hedge

# ========= RPC Configuration =========
# Multiple RPC endpoints for redundancy and performance
# Order: fastest/most reliable first. Bot will fallback to next if one fails.
# Recommended: Use at least 2-3 endpoints from different providers

# POLL_INTERVAL_MS: How often to check markets (milliseconds)
#   - 10000ms (10s): Fast, responsive, higher RPC usage - RECOMMENDED for active trading
#   - 15000ms (15s): Balanced performance and RPC usage
#   - 20000ms (20s): Lower RPC usage, still catches opportunities
#   Note: Bot automatically optimizes RPC calls during quiet periods

# STRATEGY 1: Contrarian (Mean Reversion)
# ========================================
# Buys opposite side when odds are extreme (92-98%), sells at 5X profit or holds if losing
CONTRARIAN_ENABLED=true
CONTRARIAN_BUY_WINDOW_START_END=10-30    # Buy window: minutes :10-:30 of every hour

CONTRARIAN_PROFIT_TARGET_PCT=400         # Sell at 400% profit (5X return)

# STRATEGY 2: Late Window
# ========================================
# Buys strong side in last 12 minutes (skips if contrarian position exists on same side)

BUY_AMOUNT_USDC=10                       # Late position amount

# ========================================
# STRATEGY 3: Moonshot (Simplified Hedge)
# ========================================
# SIMPLIFIED LOGIC: When late strategy takes a position, immediately check if opposite side meets odds threshold
# If yes, buy opposite side as hedge (one trade per market)
# No time restrictions - triggers as soon as late position exists and opposite meets criteria
MOONSHOT_ENABLED=true
MOONSHOT_MAX_ODDS=10                     # Buy opposite side if odds < this % (e.g., 10 = buy if < 10%)
