# ========= RPC Configuration =========
# Multiple RPC endpoints for redundancy and performance
# Order: fastest/most reliable first. Bot will fallback to next if one fails.
# Recommended: Use at least 2-3 endpoints from different providers

# POLL_INTERVAL_MS: How often to check markets during normal periods (milliseconds)
#   - 10000ms (10s): RECOMMENDED for active trading
#   - 15000ms (15s): Balanced performance and RPC usage
#   - 20000ms (20s): Lower RPC usage, still catches opportunities
# Note: Bot automatically uses these optimizations:
#   - 5 seconds during critical trading windows (contrarian & late) for fast execution
#   - 30 seconds when monitoring positions outside trading windows
#   - Up to 5 minutes sleep when no strategies active and no positions

# STRATEGY 1: Contrarian (Mean Reversion)
# ========================================
# Buys opposite side when odds are extreme (92-98%), sells at 5X profit or holds if losing

# ========================================
# STRATEGY 3: Moonshot (Late Position Hedge Only)
# ========================================
# IMPORTANT: Moonshot ONLY hedges late strategy positions - never runs independently!
# Timing: Runs during late strategy window (same as BUY_WINDOW_MINUTES) until 59:45
# - Starts checking when late strategy becomes active (last 12 minutes by default)
# - Stops checking at 59:45 (15 seconds before market closes at top of hour)
# Checks every poll cycle if conditions are met:
# - A late position exists
# - No moonshot position exists yet
# - Current time <= 59:45
# - Opposite side odds meet MOONSHOT_MAX_ODDS criteria
# If all conditions met, places one hedge trade per market
MOONSHOT_ENABLED=true
MOONSHOT_MAX_ODDS=10                     # Buy opposite side if odds < this % (e.g., 10 = buy if < 10%)
