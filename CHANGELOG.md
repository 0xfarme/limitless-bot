## Latest Changes

### ‚úÖ Independent Moonshot Strategy
**Date:** 2025-10-17

**What Changed:**
- Moonshot now operates independently in last 2 minutes
- No longer requires late window to buy first
- **Ignores MIN_MARKET_AGE_MINUTES** - can bet on brand new markets
- Buys extreme underdog (lowest odds side) if ‚â§ 10%
- Still works as hedge after late window buy (dual mode)

**Why:**
- Capture moonshot opportunities even when late window doesn't buy
- Brand new markets often have extreme odds in last minutes
- More moonshot opportunities = more lottery tickets
- Flexibility to work standalone or as hedge

**Two Operating Modes:**

**Mode 1: Independent**
```
Market at 93/7 in last 2 minutes
Late window: Skips (93% > MAX_ODDS)
Moonshot: Buys 7% side for $1 ‚úÖ
```

**Mode 2: Late Window Hedge**
```
Late window: Buys YES at 88%
Moonshot: Buys NO at 12% (if ‚â§ 10%) ‚úÖ
```

**Configuration:**
```env
MOONSHOT_ENABLED=true
MOONSHOT_WINDOW_MINUTES=2         # Last 2 minutes
MOONSHOT_MAX_ODDS=10              # Buy if underdog ‚â§ 10%
MOONSHOT_AMOUNT_USDC=1
MIN_MARKET_AGE_MINUTES=10         # Moonshot IGNORES this
```

**Log Messages:**
```
üåô Independent moonshot! Underdog side 1 at 7% (<= 10%) with $1 USDC
üåô Skipping late window moonshot - already have moonshot position
üåô In moonshot window but underdog at 15% (> 10% threshold) - waiting
```

### ‚úÖ Per-Strategy Buy Amounts
**Date:** 2025-10-17

**What Changed:**
- Each strategy can now have its own buy amount
- `EARLY_BUY_AMOUNT_USDC` - Override amount for early contrarian
- `LATE_BUY_AMOUNT_USDC` - Override amount for late window
- `MOONSHOT_AMOUNT_USDC` - Already separate (defaults to $1)
- Falls back to `BUY_AMOUNT_USDC` if strategy-specific not set

**Why:**
- Risk-adjusted position sizing
- Use less capital on riskier early trades (40-50% win rate)
- Use more capital on safer late trades (70-80% win rate)
- Keep moonshots small (lottery tickets)

**Configuration:**
```env
# Default for all strategies
BUY_AMOUNT_USDC=25

# Optional overrides
EARLY_BUY_AMOUNT_USDC=10      # Risky early trades
LATE_BUY_AMOUNT_USDC=50       # Safer late trades
MOONSHOT_AMOUNT_USDC=1        # Small lottery
```

**Example:**
```
Early contrarian: Buys with $10 (EARLY_BUY_AMOUNT_USDC)
Late window: Buys with $50 (LATE_BUY_AMOUNT_USDC)
Moonshot: Buys with $1 (MOONSHOT_AMOUNT_USDC)
```

### ‚úÖ Smart Hedging: Late Strategy + Early Losing Positions
**Date:** 2025-10-17

**What Changed:**
- Late window strategy now checks for existing early contrarian positions
- **Skips buy** if it would be same side as losing early position (no doubling down)
- **Takes buy** if it's opposite side (natural hedge)
- **Skips moonshot** when both sides already covered

**Why:**
- Prevents throwing good money after bad
- Creates intelligent hedging when holding losing positions
- Reduces risk exposure
- Moonshot unnecessary when already hedged

**Example:**
```
Early contrarian: NO at 25% for $25 (losing at min 45)
Late window: YES at 88% available
‚Üí Buys YES (opposite = hedge)
‚Üí Skips moonshot (both sides covered)

Result:
  If YES wins: -$25 + $3.40 = -$21.60
  If NO wins: +$75 - $25 = +$50
```

**Log Messages:**
```
üîÑ Early contrarian holding exists on outcome 0 - will only buy opposite side
üö´ Late window would buy outcome 0 but early contrarian already holds same side - skipping
üîÑ Late window buying outcome 1 to hedge early contrarian position on outcome 0
üåô Skipping moonshot - already have opposite side covered by early_contrarian
```

### ‚úÖ Added Deep Sleep Mode
**Date:** 2025-10-17

**What Changed:**
- Added `LATE_STRATEGY_ENABLED` configuration option
- Bot enters deep sleep mode when all strategies are disabled
- Enhanced sleep mode logging shows which strategies are active
- Hourly status updates when in deep sleep

**Why:**
- Saves resources when no trading strategies are enabled
- Clear visibility into which strategies are active
- Bot only wakes up when there's actual work to do

**Configuration:**
```env
LATE_STRATEGY_ENABLED=true      # Enable/disable late window strategy
EARLY_STRATEGY_ENABLED=true     # Enable/disable early contrarian
MOONSHOT_ENABLED=true           # Enable/disable moonshot
```

**Log Messages:**
```
üí§ DEEP SLEEP: All trading strategies disabled.
üí§ Sleep mode (Active: late_window, moonshot | Holdings: 2)
```

### ‚úÖ Removed Partial Sell Feature
**Date:** 2025-10-17

**What Changed:**
- Removed `PARTIAL_SELL_ENABLED` and `PARTIAL_SELL_PCT` configuration
- All profit-taking sells now sell **100% of position**
- Simplified sell logic - no more partial position tracking
- Cleaner code, easier to understand

**Why:**
- Simplifies strategy logic
- Easier to track PnL
- Reduces complexity
- Full exit on profit target is cleaner

**Migration:**
- Remove `PARTIAL_SELL_ENABLED` and `PARTIAL_SELL_PCT` from your .env
- No other changes needed - bot automatically sells 100%

---

### ‚úÖ Fixed Stop Loss (PnL-Based)
**Date:** 2025-10-17

**What Changed:**
- Stop loss now triggers on PnL percentage instead of odds
- Added `STOP_LOSS_ENABLED` and `STOP_LOSS_PNL_PCT` config
- Removed `STOP_LOSS_ODDS_THRESHOLD` (unused)

**Why:**
- Previous odds-based stop loss was broken
- Example: DOGE at -59.95% PnL but 59.7% odds ‚Üí didn't sell
- Now sells when PnL drops below threshold (default: -50%)

**Migration:**
```env
# Remove this
STOP_LOSS_ODDS_THRESHOLD=40

# Add these
STOP_LOSS_ENABLED=true
STOP_LOSS_PNL_PCT=-50
```

---

### ‚úÖ Added Sell Simulation
**Date:** 2025-10-17

**What Changed:**
- Simulation mode now simulates sells (profit taking + stop loss)
- Complete trade cycle simulation: Buy ‚Üí Hold ‚Üí Sell
- Full PnL tracking in simulation mode

**Why:**
- Test complete strategies without spending money
- Verify profit targets and stop loss work correctly
- Track realistic performance

**How to Use:**
```env
SIMULATION_MODE=true
```

---

### ‚úÖ Simplified .env Configuration
**Date:** 2025-10-17

**What Changed:**
- Reduced .env.example from 155 lines to 67 lines (-57%)
- Removed unused features:
  - S3 upload configuration
  - Legacy strategy settings (STRATEGY_MODE, TRIGGER_PCT, TRIGGER_BAND)
  - Per-strategy buy amounts
  - Unnecessary file path overrides

**Migration:**
- Copy new .env.example
