## 🎯 How It Works

### Trading Strategy

The bot uses a **last-minute timing strategy** to maximize win probability:

1. **Wait for buy window** - Only buys in the last 13 minutes (configurable)
2. **Check odds** - Only buys if odds are 75-95% (configurable)
3. **Stop loss protection** - Sells in last 3 minutes if odds drop below 50%
4. **Hold to close** - Otherwise holds position until market closes

### Timeline Example

```
Market opens at 12:00 PM, closes at 1:00 PM

12:00 - 12:47 PM: ⏸️  Waiting (not in buy window)
12:47 - 12:58 PM: ✅  Buy window active (if odds 75-95%)
12:58 - 1:00 PM:  🚫  No new buys (too close to deadline)
12:57 - 1:00 PM:  🛡️  Stop loss active (sell if odds < 50%)
```

### Safety Features

- **Minimum market age**: Won't buy markets less than 10 minutes old
- **No last-minute buys**: Blocks purchases in final 2 minutes
- **One position per market**: Prevents duplicate trades
- **Completed market tracking**: Never re-enters a market after exiting

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Buy already in progress for this market"**
- Normal - prevents duplicate trades
- Will retry next tick if conditions still met

**"Not in last N minutes - waiting for buy window"**
- Normal - bot only trades in configured window
- Adjust `BUY_WINDOW_MINUTES` if needed

**"No side in odds range"**
- Normal - waiting for odds to be in configured range
- Adjust `MIN_ODDS`/`MAX_ODDS` to trade more frequently

**"Insufficient USDC"**
- Add more USDC to your wallet
- Reduce `BUY_AMOUNT_USDC`

**"Gas estimate failed"**
- Check your ETH balance for gas
- Increase `GAS_PRICE_GWEI` (default: 0.005)

### Debug Tips

1. **Check logs** - All timestamps help you trace execution
2. **Review trades.jsonl** - See exactly what happened
3. **Monitor stats.json** - Track performance over time
4. **Start small** - Test with `BUY_AMOUNT_USDC=1` first

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Risk Warnings

1. **Stop loss is not guaranteed** - Depends on odds updating in time
2. **Holding to close** - Most positions held until market closes
3. **Gas costs** - Factor in ~$0.001-0.01 per trade
4. **Liquidity** - Large positions may have slippage
5. **Market expiry** - Losing positions = total loss

### Pro Tips

1. ✅ Start with small amounts
2. ✅ Monitor `data/stats.json` regularly
3. ✅ Test different odds ranges for your markets
4. ✅ Use multiple wallets to diversify
5. ✅ Check trade logs to understand bot decisions
6. ✅ Adjust `BUY_WINDOW_MINUTES` based on market behavior
