## üéØ Trading Strategies

The bot runs **two independent strategies** that can trade simultaneously on the same market:

### 1. Early Contrarian Strategy

**Concept:** Buy the underdog when one side dominates early

**How it works:**
- Active during **first 10-30 minutes** of market life
- Triggers when one side reaches **70%+** odds (configurable)
- Buys the **opposite side** (contrarian bet)
- Sells when position reaches **20-30% profit** (configurable)

**Example:**
```
Market: "Will ETH be above $3,500 at 1:00 PM?"
Time: 12:15 PM (15 mins after market opens)

Prices: Side 0 (Yes) = 82%, Side 1 (No) = 18%
Bot: Triggers! Buys Side 1 (No) at 18% for $3 USDC

12:25 PM: Side 1 rises to 25% ‚Üí Position hits 30% profit
Bot: Sells 90% ($2.70 worth), keeps 10% ($0.30) riding

Result at close: If Side 1 wins, that 10% becomes a big win!
```

**Configuration:**
```env
EARLY_STRATEGY_ENABLED=true
EARLY_WINDOW_MINUTES=30         # Active first 30 mins
MIN_MARKET_AGE_MINUTES=10       # Ignore first 10 mins (too new)
EARLY_TRIGGER_ODDS=80           # Trigger at 80%+
EARLY_PROFIT_TARGET_PCT=30      # Sell at 30% profit
EARLY_BUY_AMOUNT_USDC=3         # $3 per early trade
```

### 2. Late Window Strategy

**Concept:** High-confidence bets in final minutes before close

**How it works:**
- Active during **last 13 minutes** before market closes
- Only buys if one side has **75-95% odds** (configurable)
- Buys the **high-probability side**
- Holds until market closes (or stop-loss triggers)

**Example:**
```
Market: "Will ETH be above $3,500 at 1:00 PM?"
Time: 12:50 PM (10 mins before close)

Prices: Side 0 (Yes) = 87%, Side 1 (No) = 13%
Bot: Triggers! Buys Side 0 (Yes) at 87% for $10 USDC

Stop Loss: If odds drop below 40% in last 2 mins ‚Üí Auto-sell
Otherwise: Hold until 1:00 PM and claim if wins
```

**Configuration:**
```env
BUY_WINDOW_MINUTES=13           # Last 13 minutes
NO_BUY_FINAL_MINUTES=2          # Don't buy in last 2 mins
MIN_ODDS=75                     # Min 75% odds
MAX_ODDS=95                     # Max 95% odds
TARGET_PROFIT_PCT=20            # Take profit at 20%
LATE_BUY_AMOUNT_USDC=10         # $10 per late trade
```

### Independent Positions

**Key Feature:** Both strategies can hold positions on the **same market simultaneously**!

**Example Scenario:**
```
Market: "Will BTC be above $45,000?"

10:15 AM (Early):
  - Side 0 hits 85% ‚Üí Early buys Side 1 at 15% for $3
  - Position: early_contrarian, Side 1, cost $3

10:50 AM (Late):
  - Side 0 at 90% ‚Üí Late buys Side 0 at 90% for $10
  - Position: default, Side 0, cost $10

Result:
  - Both positions tracked independently
  - Different profit targets
  - Different capital allocation
  - Hedge against each other if needed
```

## üé≠ Advanced Features

### Simulation Mode

Test strategies without spending real money!

#### Global Simulation (All Strategies)

```env
SIMULATION_MODE=true
```

All trades simulated, logs saved to `simulation/` directory.

#### Per-Strategy Simulation (Mix Live & Simulated)

```env
SIMULATION_MODE=false
SIMULATE_STRATEGIES=early      # Only simulate early, late runs live
```

**Options:**
- `early` - Simulate early contrarian only
- `late` - Simulate late window only
- `early,late` - Simulate both
- `` (empty) - All live

**Use Cases:**

**Test New Parameters:**
```env
EARLY_TRIGGER_ODDS=80          # More aggressive
SIMULATE_STRATEGIES=early      # Test without risk
```

**Gradual Rollout:**
```env
# Week 1: Simulate early
SIMULATE_STRATEGIES=early

# Week 2: If profitable, go live
SIMULATE_STRATEGIES=
```

**Separate Log Files:**
- Live: `data/trades.jsonl`, `data/state.json`
- Simulated: `simulation/sim-trades.jsonl`, `simulation/sim-state.json`

### Multi-Wallet Trading

Run multiple accounts simultaneously:

```env
PRIVATE_KEYS=0xkey1,0xkey2,0xkey3
```

Each wallet:
- Trades independently
- Has its own state tracking
- Logs trades separately
- Can use different strategies

### Intelligent Sleep Mode

Bot automatically:
- **Stays awake** when positions are open (monitors profit targets)
- **Sleeps** during inactive periods to save RPC calls
- **Wakes up** for redemption, early, and late windows

**Active Periods:**
```
Minutes 00-30: Early contrarian active (or awake if positions open)
Minutes 06-10: Redemption window
Minutes 47-60: Late window active
```

## üí° Strategy Examples

### Conservative (High Win Rate)

```env
# Small positions, high confidence only
BUY_AMOUNT_USDC=2
EARLY_BUY_AMOUNT_USDC=1
LATE_BUY_AMOUNT_USDC=5

# Early: Only extreme dominance
EARLY_TRIGGER_ODDS=85
EARLY_PROFIT_TARGET_PCT=20

# Late: Very high odds only
MIN_ODDS=85
MAX_ODDS=95
BUY_WINDOW_MINUTES=10
```

### Balanced (Default)

```env
# Moderate positions
BUY_AMOUNT_USDC=5
EARLY_BUY_AMOUNT_USDC=3
LATE_BUY_AMOUNT_USDC=10

# Early: Standard contrarian
EARLY_TRIGGER_ODDS=80
EARLY_PROFIT_TARGET_PCT=30

# Late: Wide range
MIN_ODDS=75
MAX_ODDS=95
BUY_WINDOW_MINUTES=13
```

### Aggressive (Higher Risk/Reward)

```env
# Larger positions
BUY_AMOUNT_USDC=10
EARLY_BUY_AMOUNT_USDC=5
LATE_BUY_AMOUNT_USDC=20

# Early: Earlier triggers
EARLY_TRIGGER_ODDS=70
EARLY_PROFIT_TARGET_PCT=40

# Late: Wider odds
MIN_ODDS=70
MAX_ODDS=98
BUY_WINDOW_MINUTES=15
```

### Early Only (Test Contrarian)

```env
# Only trade early contrarian
EARLY_STRATEGY_ENABLED=true
EARLY_BUY_AMOUNT_USDC=5

# Disable late by setting impossible odds
MIN_ODDS=99
MAX_ODDS=100
```

### Late Only (High Confidence)

```env
# Disable early
EARLY_STRATEGY_ENABLED=false

# Only late window
LATE_BUY_AMOUNT_USDC=10
MIN_ODDS=80
MAX_ODDS=95
BUY_WINDOW_MINUTES=10
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Early/Late strategy already has a position - skipping buy"**
- Normal - each strategy only takes one position per market
- Other strategy can still buy independently

**"Holding remaining 10% position - PnL=X% (profit already taken)"**
- Normal - partial sell executed, keeping 10% runner
- Will hold until market close or redemption

**"Bot in sleep mode - not in active trading/redemption window"**
- Normal - saves RPC calls during inactive periods
- Will wake up when positions exist or active window starts

**"Insufficient USDC balance"**
- Add more USDC to your wallet
- Reduce `BUY_AMOUNT_USDC` or strategy-specific amounts

**"Gas estimate failed"**
- Check ETH balance for gas
- Increase `GAS_PRICE_GWEI`

**"No tokens found on-chain - position was likely already sold"**
- Normal - auto-cleanup of stale state
- Position was redeemed or sold elsewhere

### Debug Mode

Monitor logs in real-time:

```bash
# Follow all logs
npm start 2>&1 | tee bot.log

# Follow specific wallet
npm start 2>&1 | grep "0x967e"

# Watch trades only
tail -f data/trades.jsonl
```

### Reset State

```bash
# Remove all state (careful!)
rm -rf data/ simulation/

# Start fresh
npm start
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Risk Warnings

1. **Partial sells not guaranteed** - Requires blockchain confirmation
2. **Stop loss depends on price updates** - May not trigger if prices don't update
3. **Gas costs** - Factor in ~$0.001-0.01 per transaction
4. **Independent positions** - Can hold opposite sides (hedge or double exposure)
5. **Market expiry** - Losing positions = total loss

### Pro Tips

1. ‚úÖ **Start with simulation mode** - Test before going live
2. ‚úÖ **Use per-strategy amounts** - Smaller early, larger late
3. ‚úÖ **Monitor both positions** - Check `data/state.json` regularly
4. ‚úÖ **Review partial sells** - Are 10% runners profitable?
5. ‚úÖ **Test different trigger odds** - Find optimal for your markets
6. ‚úÖ **Compare strategies** - Early vs late performance in logs
7. ‚úÖ **Use multiple wallets** - Diversify across accounts

### Performance Optimization

**Reduce RPC Calls:**
- Sleep mode automatically enabled
- Only polls during active windows + when positions exist

**Save on Gas:**
- Combines approval checks
- Uses intelligent gas estimation
- Waits for 1 confirmation (configurable)
